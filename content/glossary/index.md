Here you will find definitions on terms related to several topics, as:

1. Philosophy
2. Linguistics
3. Mathematical Logic
4. Computer Science
5. Programming
6. Infrastructure
7. and so on.

The definitions (mostly in Brazilian portuguese) are intended to provide intuition and should serve both as a guide to the subject and as a companion to the [../notes](../notes/index.md).

> <red>__Disclaimer.__</red> Most of the definitions follow standard approaches found in the literature and are presented as formally as possible, while still emphasizing their primary purpose: to be intuitive. However, some of them are entirely based on my _personal point of view_.  
>
> Therefore, _do not assume them to be absolute truth_.
