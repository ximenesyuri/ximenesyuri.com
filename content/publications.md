All my publications can be found, as preprint versions, in:
1. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/a/martins_y_1.html)
2. [HAL](https://hal.science/search/index?q=yuri+ximenes+martins)
3. or directly in [this](https://github.com/ximenesyuri/writings) github repository, where you can also find some old notes, talks, books, theses, and so on.

I'm no longer submitting works to closed journals and I'm rejecting the acceptance of those that were previously submitted and are currently in reviewing process. My works will be submitted only to [Diamond Open Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_open_access) journals, where there is no publication industry involved.

Also, previously I served as referee to some closed journals on Mathematics and Physics. Now, I'm no longer accepting those invitations.
