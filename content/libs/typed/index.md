# About

{typed} is a Python framework providing type safety and allowing universal constructions.

```{toc}
```

# Overview

The framework provides a lot of _primitive types_ with a plethora of _type factories_, which can be used to build custom _derived types_. As examples of the type factories we have _type operations_, which concretely implements the annotations from the `typing` library, and flavors of _models_, which can be used to validate data. 

One time defined, the types can be used as type hints for _typed functions_, for which type hints are checked at runtime. 

So, with {typed} you have a framework ensuring type safety by:
1. defining custom types from _type factories_;
2. using those custom types as type hints for _typed functions_;
3. checking the type hints at runtime.

For a definition of the main {typed} concepts, see [glossary](./glossary).
