Here you will find documentation and expositions on some libraries I'm involved.

1. [typed](./typed/index): a Python framework that provides type safety and universal constructions
2. [utils](./utils/index): a collection of typed functions
3. [comp](./app/index): a Python component system presenting type safety
4. [cli](./cli/index): a Python library to quickly construct CLI

> <red>__Disclaimer.__</red> The libraries were constructed mostly to cover my personal needs. Also, they follow my personal point of view on how to build software and are in constant evolution.

> So, _use them with caution_.

> All the libraries are maintained in your corresponding Github repository. Contributions and suggestions are most welcome! You can create issues directly in the lib repository. For further discussion and to be notified about updates, you are invited to join our {Discord}.
