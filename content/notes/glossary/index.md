Here you will find definitions on terms related to several topics, as:
1. Philosophy
2. Linguistics
3. Mathematical Logic
4. Category Theory
5. Computer Science
6. and so on.

The definitions are intended to provide intuition and should serve both as a guide to the subject and as a companion to the [../notes](../index.md).

> <red>__Disclaimer.__</red> Most of the definitions follow standard approaches found in the literature and are presented as formally as possible, while still emphasizing their primary purpose: to be intuitive. However, some of them are entirely based on my _personal point of view_.  
>
> Therefore, _do not assume them to be absolute truth_.
