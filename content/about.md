Hi.

My name is _Yuri Ximenes Lecca_ (_Yuri Ximenes Martins_ before married). I'm a Brazilian researcher and software developer.
      
As a researcher my main interest in abstracting and formalizing. I believe that every concept has a very simple and intuitive presentation, which can be discovered through a full abstraction process. My works meet different areas, as Mathematics, Physics, Philosophy and Computer Science. For details on my publications, see <a href=/publications>publications</a>.
          
As a developer, I follow a similar philosophy: I believe in minimal, modular and abstract solutions. This means that I will include a dependence only if it is absolutely necessary. Also, I will always try to break my software in cohesive smaller reusable pieces. Finally, I do not believe in perfect or predefined complex inner architectures. More specifically, I think that abstraction should appear first in code, and then, only when really needed, in the architectural layer. For details on  some dev projects I'm involved, see <a href=/libs/index>libs</a>.

Naturally, I also have some perspective in mixing research and development: to implement some aspects of my research in proof assistants, as `Coq` and `Lean`.

I'm a strong Linux user. For the environment I use, see <a href=/setup>setup</a>.

Besides the technical scope, I follow a minimalist lifestyle and I like to be rounded of nature.
